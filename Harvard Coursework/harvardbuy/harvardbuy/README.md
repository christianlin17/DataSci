Proposal:
Welcome to HarvardBuy, Harvard's own ecommerce marketplace where student goods can be sold and bought. This elegant user interface is familiar to anyone who's shopped online before and its intuitive
design allows students to register via their Harvard College email address and post items for sale including information about that item such as the item description, location, price and pictures.
These items are sorted into categories where other users can easily browse and contact the seller if they are interested. Here are the ReadMe instructions for configuring and running this application
on CS50 IDE.

Upon arrival on the website, you should view our home page and be prompted to register an account. The navigation bar will allow you to navigate our website to log in if you already have an account if
you're interested in selling an item. Otherwise, the "home" page is open for navigation even without login for students solely interested in browsing our catalogs. If you'd like more information regarding
our webage, I'd highly recommend reading the  "How it Works" page to familiarize users with the mission of this company and the principles in which our website is build on, namely, collaboration,
connection and capitalism. Hover over the "Categories" tab and you should be given the option to select and browse all the items associated with the given categories. The magic of this webpage lies
in its coding, but more information on what happens under the hood in the design.md file. The following is information regarding the compilation of the website.

Acknowledgement to Eugenio Donati and Christian Lin for collaborating on this project, Finance.py as a beginning template for our project, Jun Jang and Randy Yan for assistance
during the CS50 Hackathon, Emma Humphrey for the go-ahead and enthusiastic support, and countless online sources for help on everything under the sun.  Without you, there would be know HarvardBuy.

Frequently Asked Questions:

Why do I need to submit 2 pictures?

For the sake of the google form, please submit two picture on your product, even if they're the same image!
More pictures help buyers make better decisions on their purchases.

Why might I see an error message when I select a category such as Men's Clothing?

Harvardbuy is in its early stages and haven't amassed enough users or products to populate every category on our website
As a result, we have some categories with no products inside and hence the error message.

Why isn't flask running?

You need to first download flask-bootstrap by entering the following code into your terminal:
sudo pip install flask-bootstrap
